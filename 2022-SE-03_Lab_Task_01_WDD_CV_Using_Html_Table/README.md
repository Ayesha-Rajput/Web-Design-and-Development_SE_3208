# 📝 Lab Task 1 – HTML Table Based CV

This is a basic **CV (Curriculum Vitae)** project created using **HTML** and a bit of **CSS**. The task was part of a lab assignment to practice structuring data using tables and adding basic styling.

## 📌 What's Included

- A **simple CV layout** built using HTML `<table>`.
- Sections like:
  - Profile Picture & Name
  - Personal Profile
  - Work Experience
- Contact details with clickable:
  - GitHub link
  - Email address
  - Phone number
- **Internal CSS** used (inside `<style>` tag in the `<head>`).
- No classes or IDs — styling done with basic selectors.

## 💡 Key Concepts Practiced

- HTML Tables (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`)
- Text Formatting (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<br>`)
- Anchors (`<a href>` for links, email, and phone)
- CSS Properties:
  - `text-align`
  - `font-size`
  - `margin` / `padding`
  - `display: flex` for centering
