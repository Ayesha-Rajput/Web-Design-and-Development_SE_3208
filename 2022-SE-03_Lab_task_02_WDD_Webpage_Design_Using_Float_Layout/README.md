# Lab Task 2 – Float Layout Based Web Page

This project is a practical assignment designed to reinforce concepts of HTML and CSS, specifically the use of the **float** property to create professional layouts. Students learn basic webpage structuring using floats, forms, embedding maps, and building visually appealing responsive pages.

## 📋 What's Included

A simple class web portal layout built using HTML and CSS:
- **Navigation Bar** with links (Home, Lectures, Labs, Resources, Blogs, Contact).
- **Welcome Section** with introductory text and an image floated to the right.
- **Highlight Banner** showcasing a key message.
- **Contact Section** with an embedded Google Map and a Contact Form.
- **Footer** with copyright.

## 💡 Key Concepts Practiced

- HTML Structure (header, nav, main, section, footer)
- Floating Elements using CSS (`float: left;` and `float: right;`)
- Form Elements (Name, Email, Phone, Message inputs)
- Responsive layout basics
- Google Maps embedding
- Text styling and button design

## 🔗 How to View

- Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
- Ensure CSS file (`style.css`) is properly linked for full design rendering.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This screenshot was captured from the local browser preview (opened via Visual Studio Code).  
> While I also used [raw.githack.com](https://www.githack.com) to generate a live preview link, it did not render the fonts exactly as designed — likely due to font loading delays or restrictions in external hosting.  
> Therefore, I included a screenshot from my local preview where the fonts and design appear exactly as intended.
