> ⚠️ **Note:** This screenshot was captured from the local browser preview (opened via Visual Studio Code).  
> While I also used [raw.githack.com](https://www.githack.com) to generate a live preview link, it did not render the fonts exactly as designed — likely due to font loading delays or restrictions in external hosting.  
> Therefore, I included a screenshot from my local preview where the fonts and design appear exactly as intended.
