# Lab Task 4 ‚Äì Grid Layout Based Web Page BoxDesign

This project is a hands-on assignment designed to strengthen understanding of **HTML** and **CSS**, with a focus on the **CSS Grid Layout** model.  
Students practiced building a multi-box grid layout using column and row spanning, precise item positioning, and grid-based design principles.

## üìã What's Included

A grid-based layout built using **HTML** and **CSS Grid**:

- A grid container with multiple boxes (Box 1 to Box 9) styled in various colors.
- Manual item placement using `grid-column` and `grid-row`.
- Items spanning across multiple columns and rows using `span` or defined start/end lines.
- Application of gaps, borders, and background colors for layout clarity.
- Vertical and horizontal alignment of items within the grid.
- A practical demonstration of positioning a grid item over another's space.

- **CSS Grid Layout Basics** (`display: grid`)
- **Grid Template Definitions** (`grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`)
- **Row and Column Gaps**
- **Grid Item Placement** using:
  - `grid-row`, `grid-column`
  - `grid-row-start`, `grid-row-end`
  - `grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`
